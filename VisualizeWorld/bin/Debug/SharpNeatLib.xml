            <summary>
            A neural network class that represents a network with recurrent (cyclic) connections. 
            
            This is a much faster implementation of CyclicNetwork. The speedup is approximately 5x depending on 
            hardware and CLR platform, see http://sharpneat.sourceforge.net/network_optimization.html for detailed info.
            
            The speedup is achieved by compactly storing all required data in arrays and in a way that maximizes
            in-order memory accesses; This allows us to maximize use of CPU caches. In contrast the CyclicNetwork
            class represents the network directly, that is, as a network of neuron/node objects; This has additional
            overhead such as the standard data associated with each object in dotNet which results in less efficient
            packing of the true neural net data in memory, which in turns results in less efficient use of CPU memory 
            caches. Finally, representing the network directly as a graph of connected nodes is not conducive to 
            writing code with in-order memory accesses.
            
            Algorithm Overview.
            1) Loop connections. Each connection gets its input signal from its source neuron, applies its weight and
            stores its output value./ Connections are ordered by source neuron index, thus all memory accesses here are
            sequential/in-order.
            
            2) Loop connections (again). Each connection adds its output value to its target neuron, thus each neuron  
            accumulates or 'collects' its input signal in its pre-activation variable. Because connections are sorted by
            source neuron index and not target index, this loop generates out-of order memory accesses, but is the only 
            loop to do so.
            
            3) Loop neurons. Pass each neuron's pre-activation signal through the activation function and set its 
            post-activation signal value. 
            
            The activation loop is now complete and we can go back to (1) or stop.

            <summary>
            IBlackBox represents an abstract device, system or function which has inputs and outputs. The internal
            workings and state of the box are not relevant to any method or class that acceps an IBlackBox - only that it
            has inputs and outputs and a means of activation. In NEAT the neural network implementations generally fit this
            pattern, that is:
            
             - inputs are fed to a network.
             - The network is actvated (e.g. some fixed number of timesteps or to relaxation).
             - The network outputs are read and fed into the evaluation/scoring/fitness scheme.
            
            From wikipedia:
            Black box is a technical term for a device or system or object when it is viewed primarily in terms 
            of its input and output characteristics. Almost anything might occasionally be referred to as a black box -
            a transistor, an algorithm, humans, the Internet.

            Method.
            =======
            1) We loop over all nodes in the network and perform a depth-first traversal from each node. 
            (Note. the order that the nodes are traversed does not affext the correctness of the method)
            
            2) Each traversal keeps track of its ancestor nodes (the path to the current node) for each step
            in the traversal. Thus if the traversal encounters an ancestor node then a cycle has been detected.
            
            3) A set of visited nodes is maintained. This persists between traversals and allows each traversal 
            to avoid traversing into nodes that have already been traversed.
            
            Note. We must traverse from each node rather then just e.g. the input nodes, because the network may 
            have connectivity dead ends or even isolated connectivity that therefore would not be traversed into 
            by following connectivity from the input nodes only, hence we perform a traversal from each node and
            attempt to maintain algorithmic efficiency by avoiding traversal into ndoes that haev already been 
            traversed into.

            Generic interface genome factory classes. Genome factories are intended to be used for creating initial
            populations, either random populations or from one or more seed genomes. However, genome reproduction
            is performed via the overloaded IGenome.CreateOffspring() methods, placing these methods on
            IGenome gives reproduction methods direct and convenient access to internal genome data.
            
            Concrete IGenomeFactory classes are expected to contain all parameters used for creating and breeding
            genomes such as (in NEAT) the number of input/output neurons, connection weight range and mutation 
            rate. Concrete IGenomes are therefore expected to be given a reference to their concrete factory class
            upon construction, this gives them access to parameters for use in IGenome.CreateOffspring() - which may 
            change during evolution, e.g. in the case of phased searching in NEAT.

            E.g. SharpNEAT's implementation of NEAT uses an evolutionary algorithm that alternates between
            a complexifying and simplifying mode, in order to do this the algorithm class needs to notify the genomes
            of the current mode so that the CreateOffspring() methods are able to generate offspring appropriately - 
            e.g. we avoid adding new nodes and connections and increase the rate of deletion mutations when in

            A random set of connections are made form the input to the output neurons, the number of 
            connections made is based on the NeatGenomeParameters.InitialInterconnectionsProportion
            which specifies the proportion of all posssible input-output connections to be made in
            initial genomes.
            
            The connections that are made are allocated innovation IDs in a consistent manner across
            the initial population of genomes. To do this we allocate IDs sequentially to all possible 
            interconnections and then randomly select some proportion of connections for inclusion in the
            genome. In addition, for this scheme to work the innovation ID generator must be reset to zero
            prior to each call to CreateGenome(), and a test is made to ensure this is the case.
            
            The consistent allocation of innovation IDs ensure that equivalent connections in different 
            genomes have the same innovation ID, and although this isn't strictly necessary it is 
            required for sexual reproduction to work effectively - like structures are detected by comparing

            Returns true if OK.

            Gets or sets a mode value. This is intended as a means for an evolution algorithm to convey changes
            in search mode to genomes, and because the set of modes is specific to each concrete implementation
            of an IEvolutionAlgorithm the mode is defined as an integer (rather than an enum[eration]).
            E.g. SharpNEAT's implementation of NEAT uses an evolutionary algorithm that alternates between
            a complexifying and simplifying mode, in order to do this the algorithm class needs to notify the genomes
            of the current mode so that the CreateOffspring() methods are able to generate offspring appropriately - 
            e.g. we avoid adding new nodes and connections and increase the rate of deletion mutations when in
            simplifying mode.

            Interface for neural network activation functions. An activation function simply takes a single input 
            value and produces a single output value. IActivationFunction allows for activation functions to be 
            plugged in to neural network implementations. Typical activation functions would be a sigmoid or step 
            function.
            
            The Calculate method has two overloads, one for each of the data types double and float, this allows
            an IActivationFunction object to be plugged in to neural network classes that are written to operate
            with either of those two data types. Typically the choice of which neural network implementation and
            floating point precision to use is part of the setting up and design of a problem domain and experiment.
            For some problem domains the extra precision of a double may be unnecessary.

            Represents a strategy for dividing genomes into distinct species.
            
            Speciation in NEAT is the process of dividing genomes in the population into distinct sub-populations (species)
            based on genome similarity, that is, we want similar genomes to be in the same specie so that they form a 
            gene pool that is more likely to produce fit offspring. This type of speciation is very much like the concept
            of clustering as used in the fields of computer science and data mining. This interface allows us to abstract
            the implementation of the speciation/clustering algorithm away from the main NEAT algorithm.
            
            Each cluster/specie is assigned an ID that is in turn assigned to the genomes in the cluster. In addition each 
            instance of the Specie class contains a list of all genomes within that specie.

            A genome class for Neuro Evolution of Augemting Topologies (NEAT).
            
            Note that neuron genes must be arranged according to the following layout plan.
                 Bias - single neuron. Innovation ID = 0
                 Input neurons.
                 Output neurons.
                 Hidden neurons.
            
            This allows us to add and remove hidden neurons without affecting the position of the bias,
            input and output neurons; This is convenient because bias and input and output neurons are
            fixed, they cannot be added to or removed and so remain constant throughout a given run. In fact they
            are only stored in the same list as hidden nodes as an efficiency measure when producing offspring 
            and decoding genomes, otherwise it would probably make sense to store them in readonly lists.

            for a set of points.
            
            The centroid calculation is dependent on the distance metric, hence this method is defined on IDistanceMetric.
            For some distance metrics the centroid may not be a unique point, in those cases one of the possible centroids
            is returned.
            
            A centroid is used in k-means clustering to define the center of a cluster.

            Tests if the distance between two positions is less than some threshold.
            
            A simple way of implementing this method would be to calculate the distance between the
            two coordinates and test if it is less than the threshold. However, that approach requires that all of the
            elements in both CoordinateVectors be fully compared. We can improve performance in the general case
            by testing if the threshold has been passed after each vector element comparison thus allowing an early exit
            from the method for many calls. Further to this, we can begin comparing from the ends of the vectors where 
            differences are most likely to occur.

             This is a circular buffer of double precision floating point numbers. 
             A circular buffer must be assigned a capacity at construction time. Values
             can be enqueued indefintely, but when the buffer's capacity is reached the oldest values
             in the buffer are overwritten, thus the buffer is best thought of as a circular array 
             or buffer.
            
             In addition to normal circular buffer behaviour this class has a 'total' variable that
             maintains the sum total of all values currently in the buffer. Therefore when the buffer 
             reaches capacity and new values overwrite old ones the total is reduced by the value being
             overwritten and increased by the new value. This allows us to cheaply (in computational terms)
             maintain a sum total and mean for all values in the buffer.
             
             Note that this class isn't made generic because of the lack of operator contraints required 
             to maintain the sum total of contained items. There are ways around this limitation but they
             affect performance or result in ugly code.

            <summary>
            A neural network implementation for acyclic networks.
            
            Activation of acyclic networks can be far more efficient than cyclic networks because we can activate the network by 
            propogating a signal 'wave' from the input nodes through each depth layer through to teh output nodes, thus each node
            requries activating only once at most, whereas in cyclic networks we have to activate each node multiple times and we 
            muts have a scheme for determinign when to stop activating.
            
            Algorithm Overview.
            1) The nodes are assigned a depth number based on how many connection hops they are from an input nodes. Where multiple 
            paths to a node exist the longest path determines the node's depth.
            
            2) Connections are similarly assigned a depth value which is defined as the depth of a connection's source node.
            
            Note. Steps 1 and 2 are actually performed by FastAcyclicNetworkFactory.
            
            3) Reset all node activation values to zero. This resets any state from a previous activation.
            
            4) Each layer of the network can now be activated in turn to propogate the signals on the input nodes through the network.
            Input nodes do no apply an activation function so we start by activating the connections on the first layer (depth == 0), 
            this accumulates node pre-activation signals on all of the target nodes which can be anywhere from depth 1 to the highest 
            depth level. Haveing done this we apply the node activation function for all nodes at the layer 1 because we can now 
            guarantee that there will be no more incomign signals to those nodes. Repeat for all remaining layers in turn.

            Default complexity regulation strategy. 
            This strategy provides a choice of hard/absolute comelity ceiling or a ceiling relative to the 
            complexity at the end of the most recent simplification phase.
            The strategy transitions from complexifying to simplifying when the ceiling is reached. 
            Transitioning from simplifying to complexifying occurs when complexity is no longer falling
            *and* complexity is below the ceiling. This is determined by tracking a complexity moving average
            calculated over the past N generations.

            Represents a complexity regulation strategy. 
            
            DetermineMode() is called once per generation. The strategy can determine (and return) which mode
            the overall search should be in by examining the stats passed to the method. Thus the simplest 
            strategy is to just return ComplexityRegulationMode.Complexifying; this results in no complexity 
            regulation.
            
            Complexity regulation was known as phased search in SharpNEAT Version 1. For more information see:

            equivalent and is much faster and therefore should be used instead of CyclicNetwork in most 
            circumstances.
            
            A neural network class that represents a network with recurrent (cyclic) connections. Recurrent
            connections are handled by each neuron storing two values, a pre- and post-activation value 
            (InputValue and OutputValue). This allows us to calculate the output value for the current 
            iteration/timestep without modifying the output values from the previous iteration. That is, we
            calculate all of this timestep's state based on state from the previous timestep.
            
            When activating networks of this class the network's state is updated for a fixed number of 
            timesteps, the number of which is specified by the maxIterations parameter on the constructor.
            See RelaxingCyclicNetwork for an alternative activation scheme.

            Encapsulates genome evaluation data; specifically whether the genome has been evaluated, the genome's fitness,
            how many times the genome has been evaluated and if more than once then the mean fitness.
            
            Mean fitness is sometimes used when evaluations are non-determininstic (where each evaluation with the 
            same parameters results in a different fitness, usually following some distribution curve) or else 
            successive evaluations use different evaluation parameters and therefore result in different fitnesses. 
            This approach is sometimes used in order to evaluate against a very computationally expensive fitness
            scheme, or indeed a computationally intractable scheme - i.e. we only execute against some subset of the
            problem space for each genome evaluation, and thus we obtain a more representative value for a genome's
            fitness by averaging over successive evaluations.

            functions often apply complex traformations to one or more underlying fitness values to obtain a value with a number 
            of attributes that are desirable in fitenss functions (e.g. smooth fitness landscape). In applying those transformations
            the end fitness value can become hard to interpret directly, as such this value can be used to provide some meaningful

            by providing mapping functions that map (connect) between nodes in sets. Node sets can be arranged as layers, however
            there is no limitation on node positions within the substrate - nodes in a set can be distributed throughout the substrate
            with no restrictions based on e.g. where nodes in other sets are located.

            <summary>
            SignalArray wraps a native array along with an offset into that array. The resulting SignalArray
            provides offset indexed access to the underlying native array.
            
            SignalArray minimizes the amount of value copying required when setting input signal values to, and
            reading output values from an IBlackBox. E.g. FastCyclicNetwork requires all input, output and 
            hidden node activation values to be stored in a single array. This class allows us to handle direct 
            access to the input and output values through their own SignalArray, thus we can set individual values
            in the underlying native array directly without having knowledge of that array's structure. An alternative
            would be to pass arrays to SetInputs() and SetOutput() methods, requiring us to copy the complete contents
            of the arrays into the IBlackBox's working array on each call.
            
            This class is effectively a substitute for array pointer manipulation as is possible in C++, e.g. in
            C++ you might do something like:
            <code>
            double[] allSignals = new double[100];
            double[] inputSignals = &amp;allSignals + 1;    // Skip bias neuron.
            double[] outputSignals = &amp;allSignals + 10;  // Skip bias and input neurons.
            </code>
            In the above example access to the real items outside of the bounds of the sub-ranges is
            possible (e.g. inputSignals[10] yields the first output signal). SignalArray also does not check for
            such out-of-bounds accesses, accept when running with a debugger attached in which case assertions will
            make these tests.

            Represents a sorted list of ConnectionGene objects. The sorting of the items is done on request

            approach is currently more convenient for use in some of the routines that work with NEAT genomes.
            
            Because we are not using a strictly sorted list such as the generic class SortedList[K,V] a customised 
            BinarySearch() method is provided for fast lookup of items if the list is known to be sorted. If the list is
            not sorted then the BinarySearch method's behaviour is undefined. This is potentially a source of bugs 
            and thus this class should probably migrate to SortedList[K,V] or be modified to ensure items are sorted 
            prior to a binary search.

            Represents a sorted list of NeuronGene objects. The sorting of the items is done on request
            rather than being strictly enforced at all times (e.g. as part of adding and removing items). This
            approach is currently more convenient for use in some of the routines that work with NEAT genomes.
            
            Because we are not using a strictly sorted list such as the generic class SortedList[K,V] a customised 
            BinarySearch() method is provided for fast lookup of items if the list is known to be sorted. If the list is
            not sorted then the BinarySearch method's behaviour is undefined. This is potentially a source of bugs 
            and thus this class should probably migrate to SortedList[K,V] or be modified to ensure items are sorted 
            prior to a binary search.
            
            Sort order is with respect to connection gene innovation ID.

            Inserts a NeuronGene into its correct (sorted) location within the gene list.
            Normally neuron genes can safely be assumed to have a new Innovation ID higher
            than all existing IDs, and so we can just call Add().
            This routine handles genes with older IDs that need placing correctly.

            <summary>
            Manhattan distance metric.
            
            The Manhattan distance is simply the sum total of all of the distances in each dimension. 
            Also known as the taxicab distance, rectilinear distance, L1 distance or L1 norm.
            
            Use the default constructor for classical Manhattan Distance.
            Optionally the constructor can be provided with a two coefficients and a constant that can be used to modify/distort
            distance measures. These are:
            
            matchDistanceCoeff - When comparing two positions in the same dimension the distance between those two position is 
            multiplied by this coefficient.
            
            mismatchDistanceCoeff, mismatchDistanceConstant - When comparing two coordinates where one describes a position in a given 
            dimenasion and the other does not then the second coordinate is assumed to be at position zero in that dimension. However,
            the resulting distance is multiplied by this coefficient and mismatchDistanceConstant is added, therefore allowing matches and 
            mismatches to be weighted differently, e.g. more emphasis can be placed on mismatches (and therefore network topology).
            If mismatchDistanceCoeff is zero and mismatchDistanceConstant is non-zero then the distance of mismatches is a fixed value.
            
            The two coefficients and constant allow the following schemes:
            
            1) Classical Manhattan distance.
            2) Topology only distance metric (ignore connections weights).
            3) Equivalent of genome distance in Original NEAT (O-NEAT). This is actually a mix of (1) and (2).

            Tests if the distance between two positions is less than some threshold.
            
            A simple way of implementing this method would be to calculate the distance between the
            two coordinates and test if it is less than the threshold. However, that approach requires that all of the
            elements in both CoordinateVectors be fully compared. We can improve performance in the general case
            by testing if the threshold has been passed after each vector element comparison thus allowing an early exit
            from the method for many calls. Further to this, we can begin comparing from the ends of the vectors where 
            differences are most likely to occur.

            <summary>
            Calculates the centroid for the given set of points.
            The centroid is a central position within a set of points that minimizes the sum of the squared distance
            between each of those points and the centroid. As such it can also be thought of as being an exemplar 
            for a set of points.
            
            The centroid calculation is dependent on the distance metric, hence this method is defined on IDistanceMetric.
            For some distance metrics the centroid may not be a unique point, in those cases one of the possible centroids
            is returned.
            
            A centroid is used in k-means clustering to define the center of a cluster.

             1) Based on a simple and fast xor-shift pseudo random number generator (RNG) specified in: 
             Marsaglia, George. (2003). Xorshift RNGs.
             http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper
             
             This particular implementation of xorshift has a period of 2^128-1. See the above paper to see
             how this can be easily extened if you need a longer period. At the time of writing I could find no 
             information on the period of System.Random for comparison.
            
             2) Faster than System.Random. Up to 8x faster, depending on which methods are called.
            
             3) Direct replacement for System.Random. This class implements all of the methods that System.Random 
             does plus some additional methods. The like named methods are functionally equivalent.
             
             4) Allows fast re-initialisation with a seed, unlike System.Random which accepts a seed at construction
             time which then executes a relatively expensive initialisation routine. This provides a vast speed improvement
             if you need to reset the pseudo-random number sequence many times, e.g. if you want to re-generate the same
             sequence of random numbers many times. An alternative might be to cache random numbers in an array, but that 
             approach is limited by memory capacity and the fact that you may also want a large number of different sequences 
             cached. Each sequence can be represented by a single seed value (int) when using FastRandom.
             
             Notes.
             A further performance improvement can be obtained by declaring local variables as static, thus avoiding 
             re-allocation of variables on each call. However care should be taken if multiple instances of
             FastRandom are in use or if being used in a multi-threaded environment.
            
            
            Colin Green, September 4th 2005
              - Added NextBytesUnsafe() - commented out by default.
              - Fixed bug in Reinitialise() - y,z and w variables were not being reset.
                
            Colin Green, December 2008.
              - Fix to Next() - Was previously able to return int.MaxValue, contrary to the method's contract and comments.
              - Modified NextBool() to use _bitMask instead of a count of remaining bits. Also reset the bit buffer in Reinitialise().
               
            Colin Green, 2011-08-31
              - Added NextByte() method.
              - Added new statically declared seedRng FastRandom to allow easy creation of multiple FastRandoms with different seeds 
                within a single clock tick.

            A static RNG that is used to generate seed values when constructing new instances of FastRandom.
            This overcomes the problem whereby multiple FastRandom instances are instantiated within the same
            tick count and thus obtain the same seed, that approach can result in extreme biases occuring 
            in some cases depending on how the RNG is used.
